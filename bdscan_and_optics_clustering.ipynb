        "\n",
        "**Definition:**\n",
        "DBSCAN is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that creates clusters based on data density and identifies outliers automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Idea:**\n",
        "Points that are close to each other form a cluster. Points that are isolated are treated as noise. The number of clusters does not need to be defined in advance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main Parameters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **eps (ε):** maximum distance to consider two points as neighbors\n",
        "* **min_samples:** minimum number of points required to form a dense region\n",
        "\n",
        "**Types of Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Core point:** has enough neighboring points\n",
        "* **Border point:** close to a core point but not dense itself\n",
        "* **Noise point:** isolated outlier\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Automatically finds number of clusters\n",
        "* Detects outliers well\n",
        "* Works with non-spherical cluster shapes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Sensitive to eps value\n",
        "* Not suitable for datasets with varying densities\n",
